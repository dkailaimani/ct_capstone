# ct_capstone

This is the capstone project I created for the Coding Temple bootcamp. I started by creating the database, then the API, and then I coded the frontend. I used SQL, HTML, CSS, Java Script, and Python. Additionally, I used frameworks such as flask for the API and react for the logo on the front-end. I also used MySQL workbench and Post Man to create the database and test the API's endpoints. My database contains 2 tables, and my Flask app contains all CRUD operations.
