# ct_capstone

This is the capstone project I created for the Coding Temple bootcamp. I started by creating the database, then the API, and then I coded the frontend. I used SQL, flask, HTML, CSS, Java Script and Python. I also used MySQL workbench and Post Man to create the database and test the API's endpoints. My database contains 2 tables, and my Flask app contains all CRUD operations.
